Fund Management: Investment teams can coordinate capital deployment while keeping their portfolio strategy confidential.
Private Payroll: Co-founders or HR can approve company-wide payroll without making employee salaries public.
With PSM, teams can finally manage shared assets in total privacy. This enables:
Authentication Layer: The on-device component that enforces the multisig's specific rules (e.g., 2-of-3 signatures required) and generates the ZK proof of execution.
Coordination Layer: A lightweight off-chain relay (like an invisible transaction queue) where signers pass transaction proposals and signatures back and forth until the threshold is met.
